## How to feed my sourdough starter?

You've received 20 grams of dehydrated organic sourdough starter. You'll only need to use 10 grams for now; the remaining 10 grams can be saved for future use.

This starter was carefully ripened and dehydrated at its peak, ensuring it retains the optimal characteristics needed to produce the best possible sourdough loaf. You will be using organic rye flour and lukewarm water throughout the process to rehydrate and feed the starter. By following these steps, you’ll have a fully developed starter ready for baking in less than a week.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Preparing Your Sourdough Starter

**Day 1: Hydrate the Starter (1:1:1 Ratio)**

To begin, take 10 grams of the dehydrated starter and place it into a clean jar. Next, add 10 grams of flour and 10 grams of water to the jar, maintaining a 1:1:1 ratio. Mix thoroughly until all ingredients are fully combined. Cover the jar loosely to allow air circulation, and let it sit at room temperature for 24 hours.

**Day 2: Feed the Starter (1:1:1 Ratio)**

On the second day, it’s time to start feeding the starter. Discard all but 10 grams of the mixture you created on Day 1. To this remaining 10 grams, add 10 grams of flour and 10 grams of water, maintaining the 1:1:1 ratio. Stir well to ensure everything is fully incorporated. Cover the jar loosely again and leave it at room temperature for another 24 hours.

**Day 3: Feed the Starter Again (1:1:1 Ratio)**

Repeat the same feeding process as Day 2. Discard all but 10 grams of the starter, then add 10 grams of flour and 10 grams of water, maintaining the 1:1:1 ratio. Mix well, cover loosely, and allow it to sit at room temperature for 24 hours.

**Day 4: Increase the Feeding Ratio to 1:2:2**

By Day 4, your starter should be showing signs of activity, such as bubbling and a pleasant, tangy aroma. At this stage, you’ll increase the feeding ratio to 1:2:2. This means you’ll keep 10 grams of the starter, but this time, you’ll add 20 grams of flour and 20 grams of water. Mix until fully combined, cover loosely, and let it rest at room temperature for 24 hours.

**Day 5: Further Increase the Feeding Ratio to 1:3:3**

On Day 5, the starter should be quite active. To prepare it for baking, increase the feeding ratio once more to 1:3:3. Keep 10 grams of the starter and add 30 grams of flour along with 30 grams of water. Mix well, cover loosely, and leave it at room temperature for the final 24 hours.

**Day 6: Your Starter is Ready for Baking**

By Day 6, your starter should be fully developed and ready to use in your sourdough recipe. It should have a strong, pleasant sour aroma and be full of bubbles, indicating that it’s well-fermented. You can now proceed to bake your sourdough loaf using your active starter.
